# Compliance Analysis Framework

## Overview

The VibeFunder Analyzer's compliance analysis capability provides automated assessment against major regulatory and security frameworks. Building on the existing ASVS foundation, this system maps security findings to specific compliance controls and generates framework-specific reports.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Control Mapping System

```python
# Example control mapping structure
COMPLIANCE_MAPPINGS = {
    "PCI_DSS": {
        "3.4": {  # Requirement 3.4: Render cardholder data unreadable
            "semgrep_rules": ["encryption-missing", "plaintext-storage"],
            "code_patterns": ["credit_card_number", "card_data"],
            "severity": "critical",
            "description": "Cardholder data must be encrypted"
        }
    },
    "HIPAA": {
        "164.312(a)(1)": {  # Access control
            "semgrep_rules": ["authorization-missing", "weak-authentication"],
            "code_patterns": ["phi_access", "patient_data"],
            "severity": "high",
            "description": "Implement access controls for PHI"
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Framework-Specific Scanners

#### PCI DSS Scanner Integration
```bash
# Enhanced Semgrep rules for PCI DSS
semgrep --config=configs/pci-dss.yml --sarif -o reports/pci-compliance.sarif

# Database security scanning
sqlcheck --config=configs/pci-db-security.yml
```

#### HIPAA Scanner Integration
```bash
# PHI detection patterns
semgrep --config=configs/hipaa-phi.yml --sarif -o reports/hipaa-compliance.sarif

# Access control verification
semgrep --config=configs/hipaa-access.yml --sarif -o reports/hipaa-access.sarif
```

### 3. Open Source Tools Integration

```

#### Lynis (System Hardening Assessment)
**Purpose:** OS-level security configuration

### 4. LLM-Enhanced Compliance Analysis

#### Control Gap Analysis Prompts
```python
COMPLIANCE_ANALYSIS_PROMPTS = {
    "pci_dss": """
    Analyze this codebase for PCI DSS compliance gaps:
    1. Identify cardholder data handling patterns
    2. Assess encryption implementation
    3. Evaluate access controls
    4. Check for secure coding practices
    
    Generate specific remediation recommendations for each gap.
    """,
    
    "hipaa": """
    Evaluate HIPAA compliance for this healthcare application:
    1. Identify PHI data flows and storage
    2. Assess access controls and authentication
    3. Verify audit logging implementation
    4. Check encryption of PHI at rest and in transit
    
    Provide detailed compliance narrative and evidence gaps.
    """
