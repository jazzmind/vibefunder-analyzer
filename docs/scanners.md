## Areas for LLM Integration

### Code Quality and Architecture Analysis
**Implementation approach:** Pass code chunks to LLMs for analysis
- **Architectural debt detection**: Identify anti-patterns and design issues
- **Code complexity analysis**: Beyond cyclomatic complexity to semantic complexity
- **Refactoring recommendations**: Context-aware suggestions for improvement
- **Documentation generation**: Automatic generation of technical documentation

### Advanced Security Analysis
**Implementation approach:** Combine static analysis with LLM reasoning
- **Business logic vulnerabilities**: Detect authorization bypasses and workflow issues
- **Context-aware threat modeling**: Analyze data flows and attack surfaces
- **Compliance gap analysis**: Map code to regulatory requirements (SOX, GDPR, etc.)
- **Security architecture review**: Holistic security design evaluation

### Custom Pattern Detection
**Implementation approach:** Natural language rule definition
- **Industry-specific patterns**: Financial, healthcare, government compliance
- **Organization-specific rules**: Internal coding standards and practices
- **Complex vulnerability patterns**: Multi-step attack vectors
- **Performance anti-patterns**: Resource usage and efficiency issues
